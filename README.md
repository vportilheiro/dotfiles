# dotfiles

Each directory contains setup/dotfiles for the corresponding tool. Note: dotfiles are saved without changing names, so may be hidden.

To install dotfiles, run
```
sh install.sh [tools]
```
where `tools` can be any of the directory names. Make sure to set `DOTFILES_DIR` and `INSTALL_DIR` correctly.
